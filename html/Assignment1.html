                        The Potter family is a very old one, but it was never (until the birth of Harry James Potter)
                        at the very forefront of wizarding history, contenting itself with a solid and comfortable existence
                        in the backwaters.Potter is a not uncommon Muggle surname, and the family did not make the 
                        so-called ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ for this reason; the anonymous compiler of that supposedly
                        definitive list of pure-bloods suspected that they had sprung from what he considered to be
                        tainted blood.The wizarding Potter family had illustrious beginnings, however, some of
                        which was hinted at in Deathly Hallows.

                        In the Muggle world ‘Potter’ is an occupational surname, meaning a man who creates pottery.
                         The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe,
                          a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer’, became corrupted in 
                          time to ‘Potter’. Linfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Muggle neighbours often 
                          called upon his medicinal services. None of them realised that Linfred’s wonderful cures for 
                          pox and ague were magical; they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering 
                          about in his garden with all his funny plants.

                <p class="describe">
                        His reputation as a well-meaning eccentric served Linfred well, for behind closed doors he 
                        was able to continue the series of experiments that laid the foundation of the Potter family’s
                         fortune. Historians credit Linfred as the originator of a number of remedies that evolved into
                          potions still used to this day, including Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. His sales of such 
                          cures to fellow witches and wizards enabled him to leave a significant pile of gold to each
                          of his seven children upon his death.
